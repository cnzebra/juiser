# Java Token Authentication Made Easy

Juiser (pronounced "juicer", a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of "java", "juice" and "user") 
is a small Java library that automates token authentication during an HTTP request.  After authentication, a simple 
but clean `User` object will be available to your code to support user-specific logic and authorization decisions.

Currently Juiser supports the `X-Forwarded-User` header with either JSON or [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515)
values.  Juiser 1.0.0 release supports Spring Boot applications, with other application environments
(e.g. Servlet only) added in the future.  If you'd like to help in this effort, please open a GitHub issue to start 
collaborating!

## Security Frameworks

Juiser has one purpose and one purpose only - to translate an authentication token
into an intuitive `User` object and make that `User` object available during a request.

You can use the `User` object during a request to perform security checks 
(like `user.isAuthenticated()` or `user.hasRole("admin")`) and get information about the user (e.g. `user.getName()`), 
etc, and this may be perfectly suitable for many applications.

However if you have any need of more powerful security controls, we recommend that you use Apache Shiro or Spring
Security and configure these frameworks to delegate to Juiser as necessary so you have one cohesive security
programming experience.

### Spring Security

Juiser already has native support for Spring Security so you can still leverage all the security controls
Spring Security provides.  You don't even need to use Juiser's `User` api at all if you don't want to - just use 
standard Spring Security classes like `UserDetails` and you'll never know Juiser is 'in the mix' at all.

That said, even with this Spring Security support, we think you'll find that our `User` API is a really nice 
enhancement on top of Spring Security and you'll probably want to use it in addition to everything else Spring Security
provides.

### Apache Shiro

We don't yet have native support for Apache Shiro, but we'll integrate as soon as we can.  Any community help in
this area would be appreciated!  Please open a GitHub issue or Pull Request to initiate discussion and we'll be happy
to help guide you!
